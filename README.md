# Transposition encryption and decryption program
Transposition encryption/decryption algorithm is used to encrypt and decrypt a string using a given key.
## Usage
transposition.py [encryption/decryption] <msg> <key>
## Note
For example, a key zebras contains the following two encryption information:
- The column of the matrix is 6
- The order to read the message is 632415
For further reading, please refer to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_cipher), specifically in the Columnar transposition part of it.
